Introduction
------------
This library provides a pure Python interface for the Brazilian Central Bank's
`Time Series Management System (SGS) <https://www.bcb.gov.br/?sgs>`_  api.
It works with Python 3.5 and above.

SGS is a service with more than 18,000 time series with economical and financial information.
This library is intended to make it easier for Python programmers to use this data in projects of
any kind, providing mechanisms to search for, extract and join series.
